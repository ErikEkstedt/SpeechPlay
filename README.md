A nice dataset from kaggle with (text, wav) pairs.

Everything in dataset.py is based on 
[DadidS Kaggle Kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/davids1992/speech-representation-and-data-exploration)

* plot average spectrogram and fft features
* plot spectrogram in 3D

Next step:
Embeddings and PyTorch! Yay!
